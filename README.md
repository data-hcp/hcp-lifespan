# HCP Lifespan Studies

## Expanding the Human Connectome Project: A Lifespan Approach

The original Human Connectome Project (HCP) pioneered the collection of high-quality data from healthy young adults (21-35 years old), providing a foundational dataset for comparative research with other populations. Building on this success, subsequent studies have been initiated to gather data on healthy individuals across the entire lifespan, from birth to old age.

##CCF-Supported Lifespan Studies

The Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) is proud to directly support the following Lifespan studies, while also providing indirect support to others through the dissemination of HCP-style protocols:

- HCP Lifespan Babies (Age 0-5): Exploring the earliest stages of brain development
- HCP Lifespan Children (Age 5-21): Investigating brain growth and maturation during childhood and adolescence
- HCP-Aging (Age 36-100): Uncovering the neural changes associated with healthy aging
- Developing HCP (Prenatal & Neonatal): Shining light on fetal and newborn brain development

These studies will collectively contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of human brain development, maturation, and aging, ultimately informing strategies for promoting healthy brain function across the lifespan.
